The solution depends on the exact cause, but often involves inspecting the `package.json` and `app.json` files meticulously.  Here's an example of how to resolve dependency conflicts using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install
yarn upgrade
```

If the problem stems from an incorrectly formatted `app.json`, ensure it contains the minimum required fields, such as `expo`, `name`, and `slug`. Correct any syntax errors in the file.  Consult the official Expo documentation for the exact keys and structures required:

```json
// Example of a valid app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app",
    // other Expo configuration goes here
  }
}
```

Remember to run `expo prebuild` before building if you made changes to app.json
