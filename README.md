# Expo CLI: Obscure Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with the Expo CLI: build failures caused by seemingly innocuous issues in project configuration or dependencies.  The error messages provided by Expo are often not very helpful, making diagnosis difficult.  This example showcases such a scenario and offers a potential solution.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run `expo start` or `expo build:ios` (or `expo build:android`).
3. Observe the cryptic error message.

## Solution

Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a demonstration of how to fix this kind of issue by carefully inspecting `package.json` and `app.json` files for inconsistencies or missing information.  Common fixes include:
* Correcting any syntax errors in JSON files
* Resolving conflicting versions of dependencies using package managers like npm or yarn
* Ensuring your `app.json` file contains all the necessary keys and information for your project
* Checking for typos and other mistakes in project files
