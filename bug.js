This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unexpected file structure or configuration.  For example, if you have a file named `app.json` that's not correctly formatted, or missing required keys, this can lead to obscure errors during the build process.  Another common cause is conflicting versions of dependencies in `package.json`.  The exact error message may vary, but often involves general build failures without clear pointers to the root cause.
